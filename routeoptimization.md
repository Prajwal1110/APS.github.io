# Route Optimization Algorithm for Multiple Stops

## Business Case:
Optimizing routes with multiple stops is crucial for efficiency in logistics and delivery operations of ride-sharing services. Algorithms that solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) or its variants help in finding the shortest path that visits all specified locations and returns to the starting point.

## Challenges:
- Ensuring the shortest path while visiting all specified locations.
- Handling large sets of locations efficiently.
- Dealing with computational complexity as the number of locations increases.

## Benefits:
- Optimizes route planning for drivers, reducing travel time and fuel costs.
- Enhances operational efficiency by minimizing delays and maximizing resource utilization.
- Improves customer satisfaction through timely and efficient service.

## Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for TSP

### Algorithm Description:
The Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is a heuristic approach to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It starts from a random vertex and repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited neighbor until all vertices are visited, returning to the starting point.

### Example Code (C++):

### Time Complexity:
- **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (nearestNeighborTSP function):**
  - **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) where \( n \) is the number of points (vertices).

### Space Complexity:
- **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (nearestNeighborTSP function):**
  - **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) for storing the path and visited status of vertices.
