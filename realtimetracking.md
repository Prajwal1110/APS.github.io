# Real-Time Tracking using Quad Trees

## Data Structures
- **Geospatial Data Structures:** Quad trees for efficient storage and retrieval of spatial data.

## Challenges
- **Accuracy:** Ensuring precise vehicle tracking in real-time.
- **Efficiency:** Handling rapid updates and queries for dynamic locations.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Navigation:** Improved accuracy in vehicle positioning.
- **Route Optimization:** Efficient pathfinding and route planning based on current vehicle locations.

## Algorithm
- **Quad Tree Implementation:** Spatial indexing to divide space into hierarchical quadrants for fast location queries.
