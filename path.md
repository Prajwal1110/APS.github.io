# Shortest Path Routing Algorithm for Distance

## Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Data Structures Used:
- **Graph Representation:** Adjacency lists.
- **Priority Queue:** Used for implementing Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently.

### Challenges:
- Handling large graphs efficiently.
- Dealing with negative edge weights (if applicable).
- Implementing efficient priority queue operations.

### Benefits:
- Optimizes navigation for drivers.
- Minimizes travel time and fuel consumption.
- Enhances user satisfaction by providing quicker routes.

### Example Code (C++):

### Time Complexity:
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
  - Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V)
  
### Space Complexity:
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
  - Space Complexity: O(V + E)
