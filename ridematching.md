# Ride Matching Algorithm using Priority Queues

## Data Structures
- **Priority Queues:** Utilized as min-heaps for efficient retrieval of the nearest available driver or rider.

## Challenges
- **Efficiency:** Matching users with drivers in real-time to minimize wait times.
- **Scalability:** Handling a large number of simultaneous requests.

## Benefits
- **Reduced Wait Times:** Users are matched with drivers efficiently.
- **Improved User Satisfaction:** Faster response times enhance user experience.

## Algorithm
- **Heap Implementation:** Using priority_queue in C++ for min-heap operations.
- **Matching Strategy:** Match the closest available driver to a rider based on priority.
