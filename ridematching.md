# Ride Matching Algorithm using Priority Queues

## Data Structures
- **Priority Queues:** Utilized as min-heaps for efficient retrieval of the nearest available driver or rider.

## Challenges
- **Efficiency:** Matching users with drivers in real-time to minimize wait times.
- **Scalability:** Handling a large number of simultaneous requests.

## Benefits
- **Reduced Wait Times:** Users are matched with drivers efficiently.
- **Improved User Satisfaction:** Faster response times enhance user experience.

## Algorithm
- **Heap Implementation:** Using heapq in Python for min-heap operations.
- **Matching Strategy:** Match the closest available driver to a rider based on priority.

## Example Code (Python)

```python
import heapq

class RideMatching:
    def __init__(self):
        self.drivers = []
        self.riders = []

    def add_driver(self, driver_info):
        heapq.heappush(self.drivers, driver_info)

    def add_rider(self, rider_info):
        heapq.heappush(self.riders, rider_info)

    def match_ride(self):
        if self.drivers and self.riders:
            driver = heapq.heappop(self.drivers)
            rider = heapq.heappop(self.riders)
            return (driver, rider)
        return None

# Example usage
ride_matching = RideMatching()
ride_matching.add_driver((1, 'driver1'))
ride_matching.add_rider((1, 'rider1'))
print(ride_matching.match_ride())
