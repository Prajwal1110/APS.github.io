### Surge Pricing Algorithm

#### Benefits and Challenges:
Surge pricing algorithms are essential in ride-sharing applications to dynamically adjust fares based on demand and supply conditions. They help in maximizing earnings during peak times and balancing demand with driver availability.

- **Benefits:**
  - Maximizes earnings during high-demand periods.
  - Encourages more drivers to operate during peak times.
  - Maintains service availability by matching supply with demand.

- **Challenges:**
  - Ensuring fair pricing without causing user dissatisfaction.
  - Handling abrupt demand spikes and ensuring smooth transitions.
  - Balancing surge multipliers to optimize both driver earnings and user affordability.

#### Algorithm:
The Surge Pricing algorithm adjusts the fare based on a base fare and a surge multiplier during peak times.
