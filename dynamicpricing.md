# Dynamic Pricing using Heaps

## Data Structures
- **Heaps:** Max-heap for managing high demand areas and adjusting prices dynamically.

## Challenges
- **Demand-Supply Dynamics:** Adjusting prices in real-time based on demand and supply fluctuations.
- **Optimized Revenue:** Ensuring fair pricing that maximizes revenue.

## Benefits
- **Fair Pricing:** Adjusting prices based on market conditions ensures fairness.
- **Revenue Optimization:** Maximizing revenue by setting higher prices in high-demand areas.

## Algorithm
- **Max-Heap Implementation:** Using a max-heap to efficiently retrieve and update the highest priced location.
